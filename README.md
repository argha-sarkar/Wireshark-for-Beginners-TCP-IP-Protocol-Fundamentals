# Guided Wireshark Project: Packet Capture and Analysis

## Project Overview

In this guided project, you will use Wireshark to learn how to:

- Capture and save packets on a physical wired network.
- Create a display filter to observe TCP/IP packets on a specific port.
- Observe HTTP and HTTPS TCP/IP protocols.
- Identify the TCP/IP protocol stack.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Capture and save packets on a physical wired network using Wireshark.
- Use Wireshark to observe the Internet Layer of the TCP/IP model.
- Use Wireshark to observe the Transport Layer of the TCP/IP model.
- Use Wireshark to analyze the HTTP Application Layer of the TCP/IP protocol.
- Use Wireshark to analyze the HTTPS Application Layer of the TCP/IP protocol.

## Requirements

- Wireshark installed on your machine.
- A physical wired network to capture packets from.
- Basic understanding of networking concepts, including TCP/IP.

## Getting Started

1. Install [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).
2. Set up your physical wired network environment for packet capture.
3. Follow the steps outlined in the project to capture and analyze packets.
